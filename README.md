- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeterMarie
- 👀 I’m interested in everything web related, and have been for quite a while now :D 
- 🌱 I’m quite proficient at PHP and JavaScript, but we learn everyday. Currently learning advanced Javascript and Web3. Best at research and technical writing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my current web3 project, but have no idea how to do that!
